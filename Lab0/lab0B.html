          Today I received an email stating I was awarded the GHC Student
          Scholarship to attend the 2020 Virtual Grace Hoppe Celebration. My
          younger sister was not thrilled that I will not be attending it in
          person, but I am just excited I was selected.

          Today I participated in the first virtual GHC Sholar Series. It was
          the title "Own Your Story" and it was an hour-long webinar presented
          by<a class="links" href="wogrammer.org" target="_blank">Wogrammer</a>.
          What was discussed was how women in STEM never really highlight what
          we have done and accomplished, but rather highlight another person
          success. I do have to admit that every topic that was discussed I have
          and still go through.
