            Today I received an email stating I was awarded the GHC Student
            Scholarship to attend the 2020 Virtual Grace Hoppe Celebration. My
            younger sister was not thrilled that I will not be attending it in
            person, but I am just excited I was selected.

            Today I participated in the first virtual GHC Sholar Series. It was
            the title "Own Your Story" and it was an hour-long webinar presented
            by<a class="links" href="wogrammer.org" target="_blank">Wogrammer</a
            >. What was discussed was how women in STEM never really highlight
            what we have done and accomplished, but rather highlight another
            person success. I do have to admit that every topic that was
            discussed I have and still go through.
